# Database-Solution-for-a-Film-Production-Company
This is a database management system I created using C#.net for a film production company called "Quiet Attic Films". Their requirement is to computerize the data that are in paper documents. This system fulfills their entire requirements perfectly. Functions of the system,
  - Adding, Updating, Searching and Deleting staff, employee, productions, etc.
